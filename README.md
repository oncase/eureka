-------A Node.js crawler-------

Examples saving the results into a TXT file and into a JSON file.


#Pre-requisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer since we'll be using it to execute the JavaScript.
You can verify you have both installed by running node --version and npm --version in a shell or command line.
If you don't have these packages installed, you can get both by heading over to the node.js downloads page which should install both Node.js and npm at the same time.
